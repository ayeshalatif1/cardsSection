## Built With

- **HTML5** – for semantic structure  
- **CSS3** – for layout, styling, and responsiveness  
- **CSS Grid & Flexbox** – for adaptive design across breakpoints  
- **Custom CSS Variables** – for consistent theming and easy color management


## Features

- Fully responsive design (mobile-first approach)  
- Clean and minimal interface with card shadows and color accents  
- Adaptive typography using `clamp()` for smooth scaling  
- Organized layout using CSS Grid for desktop and Flexbox for stacking on smaller screens  
- Consistent spacing with relative units (`em`, `rem`, `%`)

## What I Learned

Through this project, I learned how to:

- Use **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox** effectively for complex responsive layouts.  
- Apply the **mobile-first design** approach for cleaner responsiveness.  
- Use the `clamp()` function for dynamic font scaling across viewports.  
- Manage spacing and visual hierarchy using `gap`, `padding`, and relative units.  
- Debug layout issues like **empty white spaces** caused by fixed grid rows.  
- Create flexible designs that adjust smoothly without breaking alignment.
